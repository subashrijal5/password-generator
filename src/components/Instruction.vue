                      When travelling, you can encrypt your Internet connections
                      before they leave your laptop, tablet, mobile phone or
                      router. For example, you can set up a private VPN with
                      protocols like WireGuard( or IKEv2, OpenVPN, SSTP, L2TP
                      over IPSec ) on your own server( home computer, dedicated
                      server or VPS ) and connect to it. Alternatively, you can
                      set up an encrypted SSH tunnel between your computer and
                      your own server and configure Chrome or FireFox to use
                      socks proxy. Then even if somebody captures your data as
                      it is transmitted between your device( e.g. laptop,
                      iPhone, iPad ) and your server with a packet sniffer,
                      they'll won't be able to steal your data and passwords
                      from the encrypted streaming data.

                      your password from a company's server, and the rainbow
                      table of the hacker contains this MD5 hash, then your

                To check the strength of your passwords and know whether they're
                inside the popular rainbow tables, you can convert your
                passwords to MD5 hashes on a MD5 hash generator, then decrypt
                your passwords by submitting these hashes to an online MD5
                decryption service. For instance, your password is
                "0123456789A", using the brute-force method, it may take a
                computer almost one year to crack your password, but if you
                decrypt it by submitting its MD5 hash(
                C8E7279CD035B23BB9C0F1F954DFF5B3 ) to a MD5 decryption website,
                how long will it take to crack it? You can perform the test
                yourself.
